#FaceAndHandRecognition

FaceAndHandRecognition is an innovative project that combines the power of face recognition and hand tracking to enhance security measures and enable intuitive gesture-based actions.

Description
This project aims to provide a seamless and secure user experience by leveraging face recognition as a security parameter and utilizing hand tracking for gesture-based control. The system ensures that only authorized individuals have access to its functionalities by employing face recognition for authentication.

Once authenticated, users can interact with the system through hand gestures, which are tracked and recognized by the technology. Currently, the system supports basic actions such as copy, paste, and select all. However, there are plans to expand the range of available actions in future iterations.

Key Features
Face recognition for secure authentication
Hand tracking for gesture-based control
Support for basic actions like copy, paste, and select all
Intuitive and hands-free user interface
Plans for future development and expansion of actions
